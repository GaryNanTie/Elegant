# Elegant
- math pearls

In mathematics there is an aesthetic, a notion of beauty, often referred to as elegance.  For example, proofs that are pedestrian, turning the obvious crank, are eschewed in favor of those with surprising flashes of insight that bring a sense of wonder.  Typically an elegant proof is short and enables deep understanding.  The Shelah proof of the Hales-Jewett theorem comes to mind.

Recall Lewinâ€™s maxim: 
There is nothing as practical as a good theory!
